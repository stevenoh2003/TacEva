Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) are widely used in robotic tasks, because of the high spatial resolution they offer and their relatively low manufacturing costs. However, variations in their sensing mechanisms, structural dimension, and other parameters lead to significant performance disparities between VBTSs currently in use. This makes it challenging to optimize VBTSs for specific tasks, as both the initial choice and subsequent fine-tuning are hindered by the lack of standardized metrics. To address this issue, we present TacEva, a comprehensive evaluation framework for the quantitative analysis of VBTS performance. We define a set of performance metrics that capture and quantify the key characteristics displayed in typical application scenarios. For each metric, we designed an experimental pipeline that provides a structured procedure for performance quantification. We then applied this evaluation approach to multiple VBTSs with distinct sensing mechanisms. The results show that the proposed framework yields a thorough evaluation of each design, and provides quantitative indicators for each performance dimension. This enables researchers to pre-select the most appropriate VBTS on a task by task basis, and also offers performance-guided insights for the optimization of VBTS design.
